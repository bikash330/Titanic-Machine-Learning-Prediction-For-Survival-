# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Prediction-For-Survival
This is the prediction of survival in Titanic with the help of machine learning. This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge to dive into ML competitions and familiarize myself with how the Kaggle platform works.
There are three CSV files:

* train.csv: This contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 unique passengers).
* test.csv: This is the training data that has 418 passengers data. With the help of a trained model, we have to predict whether the 418 passengers survived or not.
* gender_submission: This contains the format in which we have to make a result.
* Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster.pdf: This is my solution for predicting the survival of the Titanic.
